# Yet Another Generic Swerve Library (YAGSL) Example project
YAGSL is intended to be an easy implementation of a generic swerve drive that should work for most square swerve drives. The project is documented on [here](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL/wiki).

This example is intended to be a starting place on how to use YAGSL. By no means is this intended to be the base of your robot project. YAGSL provides an easy way to generate a SwerveDrive which can be used in both TimedRobot and Command-Based Robot templates.
